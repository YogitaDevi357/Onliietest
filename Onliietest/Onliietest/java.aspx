                <p>
                    Java is a general purpose,
                    high level programming language&nbsp; developed by
                    Sun Microsystems. 
                    A small team of engineers, known as the <em>Green Team</em>, initiated the 
                    language in 1991. Java was originally called <em>OAK,</em> and was designed for 
                    handheld devices and set-top boxes. Oak was unsuccessful, so in 1995 Sun changed 
                    the name to Java and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning
                    WWW.</p>
                <p>
                    The Java syntax is similar 
                    to C++, but is strictly 
                    an object oriented programming language. For example, most Java programs contain
                    classes, which are used to 
                    define objects, and&nbsp; methods, 
                    which are assigned to individual classes. Java is also known for being more 
                    strict than C++, meaning variables and
                    functions must be 
                    explicitly defined. This means Java
                    source code&nbsp; may 
                    produce errors or &quot;exceptions&quot; more easily than other languages, but it also 
                    limits other types of errors that may be caused by undefined variables or 
                    unassigned types.</p>
                <p>
                    Unlike Windows executables (<a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/exe" 
                        target="fileinfo">.</a>EXE files) or Macintosh applications (<a 
                        href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/app" target="fileinfo">.</a>APP files), 
                    Java programs are not run directly by the
                    operating system. 
                    Instead, Java programs are interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, 
                    which runs on multiple platforms. This means all Java programs are
                    multiplatform and 
                    can run on different platforms, including Macintosh, Windows, and Unix 
                    computers. However, the JVM must be installed for Java applications or
                    applets&nbsp; to run at all. 
                    Fortunately, the JVM is included as part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is available as 
                    a free download.
