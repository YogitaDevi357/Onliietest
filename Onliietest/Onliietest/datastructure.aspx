                A data structure is a collection (grouping) of simple or structured data types 
                and a set of rules (operations) for organising and accessing the collection. 
                Some examples of data structures would be: an array, structs, classes, lists, 
                strings, stacks, queues, files and tables. The underlying theme here is that 
                each structure has a defined organisation and a set of rules that implement and 
                control the organisation.<br />
                <p>
                    Data structures can be classified as<br />

                    Simple Data Structure:<br />
                    <br />
                    Simple data structure can be constructed with the help of primitive data 
                    structure. A primitive data structure used to represent the standard data types 
                    of any one of the computer languages. Variables, arrays, pointers, structures, 
                    unions, etc. are examples of primitive data structures.<br />
                    <br />
                    Compound Data structure:<br />
                    <br />
                    Compound data structure can be constructed with the help of any one of the 
                    primitive data structure and it is having a specific functionality. It can be 
                    designed by user. It can be classified as<br />
                    <br />
                    1) Linear data structure<br />
                    <br />
                    2) Non-linear data structure<br />
                    <br />
                    Linear data structure :<br />
                    <br />
                    Collection of nodes which are logically adjacent in which logical adjacency is 
                    maintained by pointers<br />
                    <br />
                </p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">

                <br />
                Linear data structures can be constructed as a continuous arrangement of data 
                elements in the memory. It can be constructed by using array data type. In the 
                linear Data Structures the relation ship of adjacency is maintained between the 
                Data elements.<br />

                Operations
                applied on linear data structure :<br />
                <br />
                The following list of operations applied on linear data structures<br />
                <br />
                1. Add an element<br />
                <br />
                2. Delete an element<br />
                <br />
                3. Traverse<br />
                <br />
                4. Sort the list of elements<br />
                <br />
                5. Search for a data element<br />
                <br />
                By applying one or more functionalities to create different types of data 
                structures<br />
                <br />
                For example Stack, Queue, Tables, List, and 
                Linked Lists.<br />
                <br />
                Non-linear data structure:<br />
                <br />
                Non-linear data structure can be constructed as a collection of randomly 
                distributed set of data item joined together by using a special pointer (tag). 
                In non-linear Data structure the relationship of adjacency is not maintained 
                between the Data items.<br />
                <br />
                Operations

                The following list of operations applied on non-linear data structures.<br />
                <br />
                1. Add elements<br />
                <br />
                2. Delete elements<br />
                <br />
                3. Display the elements<br />
                <br />

                <br />
                By applying one or more functionalities and different ways of joining randomly 
                distributed data items to create different types of data structures.<br />
