                    computer hardware to communicate and operate with the computer software . 
                    Without a computer operating system, a computer and software programs would be 
                    useless. The picture is an example of microsoft window XP, a popular operating 
                    system and what the box may look like if you were to visit a local retail store

                                    When computers were first introduced, the user interacted with them using a 
                                    command line interface, which required commands. Today, almost every computer is 
                                    using a Graphical User Interface&nbsp; operating system that is much easier to 
                                    use and operate.</p>

                                        same time, the operating system determines which applications should run in what 
                                        order and how much time should be allowed for each application before giving
